# React Native FlatList renders empty list after successful API call

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue occurs intermittently, and there are no apparent errors in the console.

## Bug Description
The app fetches data from an API successfully.  The response data is correctly parsed and logged to the console. However, the FlatList component fails to render the fetched data, displaying an empty list instead.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe that the FlatList component remains empty, despite successful API calls and no visible errors in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the `data` prop in `FlatList` is an array and handling potential asynchronous operations properly.
